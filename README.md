# shiny\_tweetorials

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of shiny\_tweetorials is to provide a single home for all
tweetorials shared on [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/kierisi).
Tweetorials are intended to be a first pass at teaching a skill and//or
concept before creating a more permanent resource such as a video.
