# shiny_tweetorials

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of shiny_tweetorials is to provide a single home for all tweetorials shared on [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/kierisi). 
Tweetorials are intended to be a first pass at teaching a skill and//or concept before creating a more permanent resource such as a video.
